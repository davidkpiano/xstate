## [0.7.0]

### Added

- Machine configuration can now be merged into the options argument of `useMachine(machine, options)`. The following Machine Config options are available: `guards`, `actions`, `activities`, `services`, `delays` and `updates` (NOTE: `context` option is not implemented yet, use `withContext` or `withConfig` instead for the meantime)

```js
const [current, send] = useMachine(someMachine, {
  actions: {
    doThing: doTheThing
  },
  services: {
    /* ... */
  },
  guards: {
    /* ... */
  }
  // ... etc.
});
```
